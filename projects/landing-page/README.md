The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Detailed Instructions

* Save all the sections in array.
* Add each section header to the nav bar and add an event listener to it.
* Define a style for the active section in the viewport in the css file.
* Add a scroll event listener for each section to know if the section is in the viewport or not.
* There is three sections only so add a new section.
